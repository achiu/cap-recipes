h1. cap-recipes

h2. INSTALLATION

 * gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/
 * sudo gem install nesquena-cap-recipes

h2. DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of capistrano recipes which will grow to encompass many useful recipes.
The intended use for these recipes is for a ruby project which deploys using Phusion Passenger and caches using memcached.
In addition, recipes for the management of various daemon processes will be included as needed.
Feel free to contribute to this and make it better!
Any of the recipes can be used on their own (TODO).

Currently included:

 * Phusion Passenger (Setup and Deployment)
 * Apache Server
 * Memcache Process
 * Juggernaut Daemon
 * Backgroundrb Server
 
h2. SYNOPSIS

To include any of these into your deploy.rb configuration file for Capistrano:
  
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/passenger'
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/rails'
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/apache'
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/backgroundrb'
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/juggernaut'
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/memcache'
   
Or to include and activate all of them:

   require 'cap_recipes'
   
By default, these recipes will include both tasks for managing (start/stop/restart) as well as tasks for installing when available. 
The recipes also include hooks which tie all the recipes into the deployment process as appropriate.

If you wish to cherry-pick specific tasks, you can also include the management tasks, installation tasks and deploy hooks seperately.

   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/memcache/install.rb' # memcache installation tasks
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/memcache/manage.rb'  # memcache daemon management tasks
   require 'cap_recipes/tasks/memcache/hooks.rb'   # memcache deployment hooks
